# E-Mail Sender with powershell 
Send e-mails to one recipient with many attachments 

Imagine you have to send many attachments (i.o.c. pdf documents) to only one recipient, but your e-mail can only send 20 MB. This script helps you to do it faster.

# Usage

 - Open PowerShell ISE and paste the script in
 - Change folderpath recipient, subject and body
 - press RUN or "F5"
Thats all
